1)
Parsing a circle, sometimes Inkscape stores the radius for a circle as rx,or simply r.
Need to add a function that checks for either r or rx, and if true appends that as the radius to the list. 

2)
B-field of a function, needs to include other functions, and be able to change limits of
parametisation. 
Issues regarding setting 0 as np.zeros(len(aux)), maybe we can check the input as if input = 0, 
set 0 as np.zeroes(len(aux))
if input[0] = 0:
	input[0] = np.zeroes(len(aux))
else:
	pass
