# MagfieldCalcu
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to quickly find the Magnetic field around a loop at a certain point and plot this result using Plotly.
It can also parse an SVG file which allows the user to draw their desired coil on INKSCAPE. It supports loops consisting of, arcs, line segments, paths, rectangles currently.
More shapes will be added such as ellipses, curved lines.

The progam also allows the user to optimise the radius/length of wire that is used if they have a specific magnetitude of the magnetic field they require at a certain point.
The program can also plot and find the magnetic field of equations given that they are in vector form in cartesian cordinates and have a defined limit with no discontinuity.
E.g. (Rose curves,spiral functions)

Future additions/WIP:
  Self/Mutual Inductance calculator
  Addition of more shapes with the parser and functionalty for a changing radius (i.e. a function where dr =/= 0)
  Allowing the user to see the interaction between an object and the magnetic field using dipole-dipole approximations.
